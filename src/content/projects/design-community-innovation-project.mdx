## Project Overview
In late 2023, I identified an opportunity to transform downtime into strategic value at Immersion Group. After successfully prototyping with FlutterFlow on client projects, I proposed a self-initiated innovation project that would upskill our team, create a case study, and potentially develop a viable product. The result was a mobile app for the South African design community, built from concept to tested MVP over the course of 2024.

## The Challenge

  <div class="relative overflow-hidden rounded-xl bg-card p-6 border border-primary/40">
    <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-primary/10 via-primary/5 to-transparent"></div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 relative z-10">Limited Local Design Resources</h3>
    <p class="relative z-10">South Africa lacked a unified design community platform where designers could connect, learn standardized methodologies, and access quality resources tailored to the local context.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 relative z-10">Underutilized Downtime</h3>
    <p class="relative z-10">As a consulting house, designers spent time "on the bench" between projects. This downtime represented untapped potential for growth and innovation.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 relative z-10">Rapid Tool Evolution</h3>
    <p class="relative z-10">New tools like FlutterFlow and AI were emerging fast. Our team needed hands-on experience with these technologies to stay competitive and offer clients innovative solutions.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 relative z-10">Skill Development Gaps</h3>
    <p class="relative z-10">Team members were often exposed to narrow aspects of projects. Junior and mid-level designers needed broader experience across the full product development lifecycle.</p>

</ul>

## Process & Approach

### Strategic Foundation
I presented management with a multi-objective value proposition: upskill staff during downtime, create a client case study showcasing rapid prototyping capabilities, and potentially develop a revenue-generating product. After receiving approval in early 2024, I assembled a team including a Scrum Master, UI designer, lead researcher, junior UI designer, and two UX designers.

The app concept emerged from discussions with leadership: a mobile community platform for South African designers where Immersion Group could establish thought leadership and design standards. The vision included educational content, networking features, and eventually course materials centered around design thinking methodology.

### Adaptive Rapid Methodology
We developed our own framework by adapting established processes to our context. The Google Design Sprint was condensed from five days to three. When team members got pulled onto client work, we paused and resumed rather than forcing continuity. This flexibility proved essential for a self-initiated project in a consulting environment.

Research was distributed strategically. We split the team based on strengths: one person handled competitor analysis, another focused on user interviews, others tackled information architecture. Everyone contributed to ideation sessions, then we delegated specific design and development tasks. I regularly assessed skill gaps and assigned work that would stretch team members into new areas.

### Building and Testing
I built the MVP using FlutterFlow for the frontend, Supabase for backend and authentication, Buildship for integrating OpenAI API for an AI-powered feature. The AI chatbot was trained on Immersion's design methodology to provide contextual guidance to users.

Key features included:
<ul>
  <li>Onboarding assessment where designers self-evaluated skills to identify gaps</li>
  <li>Matching system to connect designers with complementary skills</li>
  <li>Social feed similar to Instagram for sharing design work</li>
  <li>Chat functionality for designer-to-designer communication</li>
  <li>AI assistant trained on design thinking methodology</li>
</ul>

We tested with approximately 10 users and discovered an important insight: junior designers found significant value in the skill assessment and community features, but senior designers were less engaged. This led us to pivot and add a mentorship feature specifically designed for senior designers to contribute their expertise.

Throughout the project, I maintained regular check-ins with the team to ensure everyone felt heard and involved. We ran it like a proper client engagement, complete with playbacks, retros and stakeholder reviews with management.
