## Project Overview
A South African financial institution needed to transform their digital presence to meet modern banking demands. As Senior UI Designer, I played a key role in reimagining their digital experience across web, mobile, and secure banking platforms.

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Multiple User Types
The project faced the challenge of serving distinct user needs across personal and business banking platforms. Each user segment had unique requirements and expectations, yet needed to maintain a consistent brand experience.

To address this, we developed a flexible design system that could accommodate different user needs while maintaining visual consistency. This involved:
- Creating modular components that could be configured for different use cases
- Establishing clear visual hierarchies for different user types
- Developing responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Conducting stakeholder reviews and presentations to ensure alignment with stakeholders' needs

### Technical Constraints
Platform-specific limitations required careful consideration in the design process. Legacy systems and varying technical capabilities across platforms posed significant challenges to maintaining a consistent user experience.

Our solution involved:
<ul class="list-none space-y-3">
  <li class="flex items-start">
    <span>Early and constant collaboration with development teams to understand technical boundaries</span>
  </li>
  <li class="flex items-start">
    <span>Creating adaptive designs that could gracefully degrade when needed</span>
  </li>
  <li class="flex items-start">
    <span>Developing alternative solutions for platform-specific limitations</span>
  </li>
</ul>
