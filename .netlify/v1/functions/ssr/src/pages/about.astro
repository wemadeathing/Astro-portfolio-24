          If I were to choose a word to describe my approach, it would be "technical." Not technical in the way engineers are, but technical in understanding how things actually work. This fluency allows me to collaborate seamlessly with developers, turning ideas into solutions that don't just look good but are buildable, scalable, and grounded in reality. Over 15+ years, I've evolved from pure visual design to someone who designs, prototypes, and ships. I bring creativity and technical understanding together, which means fewer surprises in implementation and more value delivered to users.
